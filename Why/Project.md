**1) Define "share price movement towards equity."**
"Share price movement towards equity" is essentially about **tracking and predicting how a company's stock price will change over time.**

It's focused on understanding:
- Why a stock's price goes up or down.
- Where it might go next.

**2) Why a stock's price goes up or down.**
When more people want to buy a stock than sell it (high demand, low supply), the price goes UP.
When more people want to sell a stock than buy it (low demand, high supply), the price goes DOWN.

**3) What were the main objectives you aimed to achieve with this project?**
To study future prices of ICICI Bank.
To determine the trend of the stock prices.
To analyze and predict future price movements of chosen equity shares.
To find out which equity share is preferable for investors, meaning when to buy and when to sell a particular stock.
To study the trend of Share Price Movement Towards Equity over the period from 16-01-2221 to 05-03-2221.
To analyze the share price behavior of the selected industries.
To predict the day-to-day fluctuations in the stock market using Technical Analysis.
To study the price movements in the stock exchange.
To study the current trend and strength of the trend of the selected industry.
To recapitulate the key findings and offer suggestions to investors

**4) What is "Share Price Movement Towards Equity" (or "EQUITY analysis") and what is its primary purpose?**
"Share Price Movement Towards Equity" (or "Equity Analysis") refers to the study and prediction of future stock price trends.
Its primary purpose is to help investors decide when to buy or sell a particular stock.
It primarily achieves this by:
- Analyzing past market actions: This often involves looking at historical price charts and identifying patterns.
- Assuming market efficiency and repetition: It's based on the idea that all relevant information is already reflected in the stock's current price, and that historical patterns tend to repeat themselves due to market psychology.
It's important to note that this approach, often referred to as technical analysis, typically focuses on price and volume data, rather than the company's financial health or broader economic factors (which are the focus of fundamental analysis).

**5) What are the key assumptions that underpin EQUITY analysis?**
"Equity analysis," particularly in the context of "share price movement towards equity" (often synonymous with technical analysis), rests on several key assumptions:

1. **The Market Discounts Everything (or Price Reflects All Information):** Technical analysts believe that the price at any given time reflects all known fundamental factors affecting the supply and demand for the product.
2. **Prices Move in Trends:** Prices tend to move in identifiable trends (up, down, or sideways), and once a trend is established, it tends to persist. Identifying these trends is crucial for successful EQUITY analysis
3. **History Tends to Repeat Itself:** This means that because people tend to react similarly in the market, stock prices often form the same visual shapes on charts. By learning to recognize these recurring chart shapes, you can predict where the price is likely to go next.
4. **Price is Determined by Supply and Demand:** a stock's price is determined solely by how many people want to buy it (demand) versus how many people want to sell it (supply) at any given moment.

**6) What were the limitations of your project?**

**Restricted Data Period:** The data was collected only for the financial year 2221-2222, and the analysis period was specifically limited to a short duration from 16/01/2221 to 05/03/2221 (45 days or two months), which may not be sufficient for comprehensive study.
**Limited Geographical Scope:** The study was confined to only one state, Telangana.
**Insufficient Parameters:** The analysis relied on only three technical parameters (Simple Moving Average, Relative Strength Index, and Rate of Change), which the project itself noted "may not be enough to predict the future price movements accurately".
**Reliance on Limited Data:** The prediction accuracy was constrained by using only one year of historical data.
**Information Source Dependency:** The study was carried out based on information and documents provided by the organization and interactions with its employees

**What suggestions have you given?**
For ICICI Bank my suggestion was to sell the shares. The data I looked at, including moving averages and other indicators, showed that the share prices were trending downwards. So, my recommendation was to sell those shares at that time.

**What are the findings?**
My findings were based on a study of the share price movements of several companies, specifically ICICI Bank. I used a few different technical analysis tools like the Simple Moving Average, Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Rate of Change (ROC).
**ICICI Bank:** The analysis indicated a declining trend in the share price, suggesting it would likely continue to fall.

**what is your conclusion?**
The main conclusion is that the share prices of the company, I studied—ICICI Bank were likely to go down. I came to this conclusion by looking at their price movements. My recommendation was to sell the shares of these company at that time.
