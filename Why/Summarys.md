After classes, we often hang out together—sometimes sitting at bus stops, chatting for hours. sometimes we skip college and go to movies, birthdays parties.
when we want to leave the college during class hours, we pay small amount to the security guard and go out.
2 years after completing graduation, i went back to college. i wear a mask,
but the security guard still remembered me and came up to me i still can't forget the moment. On weekends, we would plan short trips to nearby tourist spots and we spent time.
One of the most unforgettable moments was when my brother suddenly called and asked me to go out with him.
Even though I had an exam that day, I chose to skip it and went with him.

#Recently_visited
Recently, I went to Karnataka with my family. It was a unique experience for me. We visited the ISKCON Temple, Dharmasthala, and Kukke Subramanya Swamy Temple. Our main reason for going to the Kukke Subramanya Swamy Temple was to perform a pooja. We woke up early in the morning and went to perform it. The pooja took about half a day to complete. After the pooja, we had certain dietary restrictions for upto 12 days — we could not eat certain food items or any food mixed with specific ingredients. We didn’t know about these rules before visiting the temple, so we found it difficult to get proper food.
